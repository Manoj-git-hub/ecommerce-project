## About

This is a RESTful API for a modern e-commerce application, built using the powerful Spring Boot framework. It provides a scalable and secure backend for managing core e-commerce features, including user authentication, product management, shopping cart functionality, and order processing. The API is designed to be easily consumed by any frontend client.

## Features

* **User Management**: Secure user registration, login, and authentication using JWT.
* **Product Catalog**: CRUD operations for products and categories.
* **Shopping Cart**: Functionality to add, remove, and update items in a user's shopping cart.
* **Order Processing**: Create orders and track their status.
* **Role-Based Authorization**: Differentiate between `USER` and `ADMIN` roles.
* **Exception Handling**: Consistent and predictable API responses for errors.

## Technologies

* **Java**: The primary programming language (JDK 17+).
* **Spring Boot**: The core framework.
* **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
* **Spring Data JPA**: For data access and persistence with Hibernate.
* **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation.
* **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development and testing.
* **JWT**: For secure token-based authentication.
* **JUnit 5** & **Mockito**: For unit and integration testing.

## Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
* Maven
* An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code)
* Git

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Manoj-git-hub/ecommerce-project.git](https://github.com/Manoj-git-hub/ecommerce-project.git)
cd your-repo-name

2.Configure the application
The application uses an in-memory H2 database by default. You can configure a production database by editing the src/main/resources/application.properties file.

3.Build and run the application
# Build the project and run tests
./mvnw clean install

# Run the Spring Boot application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
The application will be running at http://localhost:8080

Project Structure
The project follows a standard Maven and Spring Boot directory structure.

API Endpoints
For a complete list of API endpoints, please refer to the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation. After running the application, you can access the Swagger UI at:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Environment Variables
The application requires the following environment variables to be set for production deployments.

Variable Name	    Description
DATABASE_URL	    URL for the production database.
DATABASE_USERNAME	Username for the database connection.
DATABASE_PASSWORD	Password for the database connection.
JWT_SECRET_KEY	A long, random string used to sign JWTs

Deployment
The application is easily deployable to any cloud platform that supports Java applications.

Using a Docker Container
1.Build the Docker image: docker build -t your-app-name .
2.Run the container: docker run -p 8080:8080 your-app-name

On a PaaS (e.g., Heroku)
1.Set up the Heroku CLI.
2.Create a Heroku app: heroku create your-app-name
3.Push your code: git push heroku main

How to Run Tests
You can run all the unit and integration tests using the following command:

Bash
./mvnw test

Architecture
The project follows a standard layered architecture with a clear separation of concerns:
1.Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and returns responses.
2.Service Layer: Contains the core business logic.
3.Repository Layer: Manages data access operations with the database.

Future Enhancements
- Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe, PayPal)
- User Reviews and Ratings system
- Robust search functionality
- Admin Dashboard for product and order management
